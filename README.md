           datetime
---------------------------------

The datetime module in Python is a built-in module that provides classes and functions for working with dates, times, and time intervals. It allows you to manipulate, format, and perform calculations on dates and times.

The datetime module includes the following main classes:

- `datetime`: Represents a specific date and time, including year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.
- `date`: Represents a date without time, including year, month, and day.
- `time`: Represents a time without a date, including hour, minute, second, and microsecond.
- `timedelta`: Represents a duration or difference between two dates or times, allowing you to perform arithmetic operations on them.

Using the datetime module, you can create datetime objects to represent specific dates and times, extract various components from them, format them as strings, compare dates and times, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

Additionally, the datetime module provides functions for getting the current date and time, parsing strings to create datetime objects, and converting datetime objects to different formats.

Overall, the datetime module in Python is a powerful tool for working with dates and times. It offers a wide range of functionality to handle various time-related operations, making it useful for tasks such as date manipulation, time calculations, scheduling, and more.

           threading
---------------------------------

The threading module in Python is a built-in module that allows you to create and manage threads in your Python programs. Threads are separate paths of execution within a program that can run concurrently, allowing you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

The threading module provides a Thread class that you can use to create new threads. You can define a target function that represents the code that will run in the new thread. The Thread class also provides methods for starting and stopping threads, as well as various synchronization mechanisms for coordinating the execution of multiple threads.

Key features of the threading module include:

- Thread creation: You can create new threads by subclassing the Thread class or by passing a target function to the Thread constructor.
- Thread synchronization: The threading module provides synchronization primitives such as locks, events, conditions, semaphores, and barriers to coordinate the execution of multiple threads and prevent race conditions.
- Thread communication: You can use thread-safe data structures like queues to exchange data between threads and facilitate communication.
- Thread management: The threading module allows you to control the lifecycle of threads, set thread names, set thread daemon status, and manage thread priorities.
- Thread safety: The threading module provides mechanisms to protect shared resources and ensure thread safety, such as locks and mutexes.

Threading is useful in scenarios where you want to perform tasks concurrently, such as handling multiple network connections, processing data in parallel, or improving the responsiveness of GUI applications.

However, it's important to note that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the true parallelism of threads. While threads can provide concurrency, they may not fully utilize multiple CPU cores due to the GIL. For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing is often a better choice.

Overall, the threading module in Python enables you to create and manage threads, allowing you to build concurrent and responsive applications that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

              time
---------------------------------

In Python, the `time` module is a built-in module that provides various functions for working with time-related operations. It allows you to measure time intervals, delay program execution, and manipulate time values.

Here are some key functions and features of the time module:

- `time()`: Returns the current time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970).
- `sleep(seconds)`: Suspends the execution of the program for the specified number of seconds.
- `ctime(seconds)`: Converts a time in seconds to a string representing a readable time and date.
- `gmtime([seconds])`: Converts a time in seconds to a struct_time object representing UTC time.
- `localtime([seconds])`: Converts a time in seconds to a struct_time object representing local time.
- `strftime(format, struct_time)`: Converts a struct_time object to a string representation based on the specified format.
- `strptime(string, format)`: Parses a string representing a time and returns a struct_time object.
- `time_ns()`: Returns the current time in nanoseconds since the epoch.
- `perf_counter()`: Returns a high-resolution performance counter for timing purposes.
- `process_time()`: Returns the sum of the system and user CPU time of the current process.

The `time` module also provides the `struct_time` object, which represents a time value as a named tuple with attributes such as year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and more.

You can use the `time` module for various time-related operations, including measuring program execution time, formatting and parsing time strings, waiting for a specific period, and more.

It's worth noting that the `time` module provides basic functionality for working with time, but for more advanced time-related operations, you may consider using the `datetime` module or third-party libraries such as `arrow` or `pendulum`, which offer additional features and flexibility.

# Explication


The program is a reminder application built using Python and the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a simplified overview of how the program works:

1. The program starts by creating a Tkinter window with a fixed size and sets up the necessary widgets like labels, entry fields, and buttons.

2. When the user adds a reminder by entering an event, time, and optionally the number of days, the program validates the input and stores the reminder details in a list called `events`.

3. The program creates a label and a cancel button for each reminder and displays them in a scrollable frame using a Canvas and Frame widget combination.

4. For each reminder, a separate thread is started using Python's threading module. The thread runs in the background and calculates the countdown time until the reminder event.

5. The countdown time is updated every second, and when the remaining time reaches zero or goes below zero, a reminder popup is shown using the `messagebox` module from Tkinter.

6. If the user clicks the cancel button for a reminder, the program removes the reminder from the `events` list and updates the GUI to remove the corresponding label and cancel button.

7. The program uses various functions from the `datetime` module to handle time-related operations, such as parsing time inputs, calculating target times, and formatting time values.

8. Tkinter's messagebox module is used to show error messages and reminder popups to the user.

9. The program utilizes the main event loop (`root.mainloop()`) of Tkinter to handle user interactions and update the GUI.

Overall, the program allows users to add reminders, displays the countdown time for each reminder, and shows reminder popups when the time is up. It provides a simple graphical interface for managing and tracking reminders.

# How to use it ?


To use the reminder application, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) if you don't have it already.

p.s (The .exe version will release maybe in 1 week or less when it will realease i will remove the step one)


2. Install Tkinter: Tkinter is included with Python by default, so you don't need to install it separately.

3. Set up the environment: Open a code editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) where you can write and run Python code.

p.s (Like I said a .exe version will realease so stay tuned)


4. Copy the code: Copy the entire code of the reminder application and paste it into your code editor or IDE.

5. Run the code: Run the Python script. You can do this by clicking the "Run" or "Execute" button in your code editor/IDE, or by running the script from the command line using the `python` command followed by the filename.

6. Use the reminder application: The application window will appear. You can add reminders by entering the event name, time (in HH:MM format), and optionally the number of days. Click the "Add Reminder" button to add the reminder. The reminder will be displayed in the application window with a countdown timer.

7. Cancel a reminder: If you want to cancel a reminder, click the "Cancel" button next to the reminder in the application window. The reminder will be removed from the list, and the corresponding label and cancel button will disappear.

8. Receive reminders: When the time for a reminder is reached, a popup window will appear with the event details.

9. Close the application: To close the reminder application, simply close the window or terminate the Python script execution.

Note: Make sure you have a working graphical user interface (GUI) environment, as Tkinter requires a GUI to display the application window and interact with the user.
